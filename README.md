# Neural networks for Collaborative Filtering

## Getting Started

These instructions will get help get your own copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
In order to run the code you need:
```
Tensorflow 0.10+, Python 3
```

### Data

You can download the datasets by using the import.sh script from the bash subfloder.

In order to specify the Dataset, you should add an option next to the script:

```
./import.sh <number>
```

* 0 : 100K
* 1 : 1M
* 2 : 10M

Then you can choose the configuration by changing the first line on the main.py file.
For example:

```
from config.autoencoder.U_1M import Experiment
```
This runs the Autoencoder for 1M dataset under U setting (user setting)

```
from config.stability.V_1M import Experiment
```
This runs the Stability for 1M dataset under V setting (movie setting)

You can change the experiment parameters under the config/ subfolder.

A setup script will be added soon.
